# Object Detection
Here I have implemented few methods of object tracking possible. The object in the project is Pedestrians/ Humans

# Method 1 - Haar Cascade

1. The cascade file is downloaded from the following repository - https://github.com/anaustinbeing/haar-cascade-files/blob/master/haarcascade_fullbody.xml
2. The results with this haar cascade are not very satisfactory as they are not able to detect the pedestrians from a side angle.
